Shell standard input and output

running ls will print out the content of a directory but what if you want to instead write the result of ls to a file.

1. use >
ls > results.txt
=== write the result of ls into a file called results.txt
---- If results.txt is has some text in it, using > will delete everything inside that file. but if its empty, > will create it.

2. use >> 
ls >> results.txt

just like >, >>  will NOT however delete the content inside that file but just concatinate/ append the new data to the end of the existing datat in the file.

===================== Writing error messages in a file
ls fish/apple/me
list out the content inside the me file at fish/apple path
Because this path does not exist on my computer, an erro will be thrown at me.
So if i want to write/ store the error message in a file, i write 2>> or 2>
2> will overwrite the file content
2>> will append to the file.

======== concatenating================
to join two files together though cat can be used to see the content inside a file.
cat file1.tx file2.txt

---- join the content in file1.txt with that of file2.txt and print the result out.
cat file1.txt file2.txt >> file12.txt
after joining files write the result into file12.txt
*** Note
you can join more than two file together. ***

cat can be used to ask for input from the user
cat {enter}
press Ctrl + d to exist out

cat > answers.txt
ask for input from the user and save it inside answers.txt in overwrite mode
